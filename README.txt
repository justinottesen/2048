2048 by Justin Ottesen

Completely based on the popular game, 2048 (found at https://play2048.co/).

12/23/22 - 
Wanted a quick project to mess around with and get used to C++ agian after
months of using C and MIPS Assembly. Will probably code in a player, which
will become better over time. For now, just works.

FUTURE PLANS:
- Saving mid-round and high score
- Automatic player
    - Simulation with statistics
    - watch it play and takeover again at certain score
    - try different strategies
- Graphics with OpenGL? Want to learn that anyways but STEEP learning curve
